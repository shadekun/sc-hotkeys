# Shinobi Chronicles Helper / Hotkeys / Ragebar / Whatever

Back in the day, I didn't really use it for more than travel & having all of my jutsu in combat.

I intended on implementing a quick-transfer for AK / Yen and Missions but I don't know how actively those features are requested and the primary functionality seems to be combat-related. If you want to see those features get implemented, see the disclaimer below.

**Update**: Firefox now has the same issue that Google Chrome used to have follow the instructions below in order to get it operating on both browsers
1. Open this link https://shinobichronicles.com
2. Open the developer console (F12)
3. Paste: `document.cookie = document.cookie + ";path=/;Secure=1;SameSite=None";`
4. Then load the external site (whether hosted on your machine or through the one hosted on the repository at https://sc.shadekun.com)


Disclaimer: I do not actively play this game. I've verified most of the content is about what it should be but since there are updates regularly to it now, some jutsu/bloodlines may be missing or have invalid information.
Due to the way the game works, this shouldn't really be a problem.

If you find a problem, go ahead and either notify me in the #shinobi-chronicles section of the official `World Of Bleach / SC / SCO` Discord by mentioning @Shadekun#7501 or by opening an issue on github.

Have fun gamers o7
